# torsynth

This is the source code of `torsynth`, a tool for generating and working with synthetic Tor consensuses.

It is part of the following scientific publication:

> **Modeling Tor Network Growth by Extrapolating Consensus Data**, Christoph DÃ¶pmann and Florian Tschorsch, Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES 2023), August 29-September 1, 2023, Benevento, Italy, https://doi.org/10.1145/3600160.3600164.

This repository only contains the implementation of our methodology for _scaling_ Tor consensuses as outlined in the paper. Its main Rust crate is therefore called `torscaler`.
